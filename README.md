# Specifying higher inductive types

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gdijkstra/homotopy-initiality.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gdijkstra/homotopy-initiality)

This project aims to formalise a notion of higher inductive types and
prove general properties about them. Most importantly we want to be
able to do the following:

 - give a specification of a higher inductive type

 - generate the induction principle of that type given its
   specification

 - specify its algebras and algebra morphisms

 - show that the induction principle implies homotopy initiality and
   vice versa
